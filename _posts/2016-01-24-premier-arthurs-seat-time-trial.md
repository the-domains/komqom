# Premier Arthurs Seat Time Trial 

## Founded by Craig MacGregor (keeper of the event constitution) and first year fellow competitors Barrie Neilson, Dave Shaw and Nick Walker this is a single timed lap time trial of Arthurs Seat. Fastest time wins King of the Mound. Most improved time (by handicap) wins Queen of the Mound.

## The winners of both events win one half of the "Silver Tassie" - it is possible to unite the Tassie, a feat fabled amongst the competitors.
